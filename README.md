NYUDaily
========

Web-based app made during HACKNYU. The point of the app is to allow for NYU students to keep track of their schedules and always go to class on time. This app is especially useful for students who want to utilize the Route A Bus, since it goes from the Poly campus to NYU's main campus. There will also be MTA directions and biking directions and NYU shuttle bus schedules.

** Progress **
- Need to add the actual database implementation and the MTA and Google maps API

** Looking For **
- Need scrappers that will scrape the NYU site and the NYU bus schedules. Just send a pull request and I will test it out.
